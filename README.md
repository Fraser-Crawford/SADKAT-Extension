# SADKAT-Extension
This project aims to extend the functionality of SADKAT (https://github.com/tranqui/sadkat) to droplets that don't possess a uniform concentration profile. 

To use:
1. Clone the repo to your machine.
2. Install the dependecies found in "requirements.txt" using your package manager of choice (pip / conda).
3. Make a new "main.py"/"notebook.ipynb" file in the folder.
4. In that file, import solution_definitions, viscous_definitions, uniform and radial
   
      `import solution_definitions, viscous_definitions, uniform, radial`

All other information for usage is in the wiki, found on the top bar.
